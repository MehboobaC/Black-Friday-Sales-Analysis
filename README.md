# Black-Friday-Sales-Analysis
Black Friday is an informal name for the day following Thanksgiving Day in United States. It is traditionally the busiest shopping day of the year and it is the ignition of one of the busiest shopping season in a year. Many stores offer highly promoted sales on this day because consumers are eager to spend so much money during this period, retailers seriously look forward to good preparation for the shopping holiday. From data science point of view, the ability to recognize and understand pattern from data using exploratory data analysis and sales prediction will help the retailers for their preparation on the same. The data set here is on Black Friday Sales for selected high volume of products of last season which contains customer demographics (age, gender, marital status, city type, stay in current city), product details (product id and product category) and total purchase amount. The purpose of this project is to understand customer behavior in Tableau and effectively predict how much a customer is probably to spend at a store based on historical purchasing patterns using python. If retailers comprehensively understand their customers in terms of characteristics, behaviors and motivations in the previous shopping seasons, they can implement and develop more effective marketing strategies for specific customer categories.
